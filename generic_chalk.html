										<h1>THE STORY OF CHALK AND CHUCKLES</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/chalk1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The inspiration behind Chalk and Chuckles wasn't an excessive focus on screens or a search for activities that would keep kids constructively engaged. We were in the midst of reflecting on our personal journey in life. Looking for an apt metaphor to describe it, Pallavi chose "Life is a game," adding, "You've got to play the cards you're dealt with." We spoke about all the enabling factors and skills in our life at rock bottom! The 4 that stood out were Grit, Vision, Flexibility & Love. This led us to combine the 3 most important things that had shaped us as people, (our family, our education, and our play experiences) into Chalk and Chuckles.

										Looking outwards at society, the struggles parents were echoing, and the experiences children were living, further clarified our values. We knew fostering self-awareness, creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and meaningful communication was the way forward, and we began to infuse them into the products we developed.
										
										Since its inception in 2013, we have made products that reflect our commitment to family, community, cooperation, respect, and the power of honest communication. Chalk and Chuckles is founded by 2 sisters Pallavi and Prachi who both switched their careers to devote themselves to their passionate endeavour!
										
										<b>OUR PRODUCTS FOCUS ON THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD</b>
										Our product line focuses on the skills and qualities you want most for your child- active, confident, curious, flexible, creative, independent, worthy, connected, kind, and happy!
										
										
									</p> 
									<h2> THINKER & INNOVATOR</h2>
									
									<p>When children wonder, think, explore, discover, strategise and solve problems with THINKING & LOGIC TOYS they develop new strengths, interests, and passions.
										
										It's in play where you learn to analyse your options, plan ahead and learn the most important life lesson- every action has consequences!
										
										Cautious or Risk-taker? Rule-driven or Flexible? Square or the round pegs in the square holes?
										
										You are what you play! </p>

									<h3>CHEERFUL & CREATIVE </h3>
									<p> When children play with CREATIVE TOYS they let their imagination run wild, express their feelings and respond to experiences. They develop new ideas and create.

										It's in creative play where you discover yourself and find new solutions to old problems! Creativity in thought is just as important as creativity in art.
										
										Writer or the Artist? Ideator or the Maker? Explorer or the Collector? 
										
										You are what you play!
									</p>
									<h4>HAPPY & CONFIDENT </h4>
									<p>When children play with our HAPPY TOYS & GAMES, they build the core skills they need for success in school, and in life. Watch their self-esteem soar with their new achievements!

										It's in play where you try out new roles and tricky tasks. You lead, follow, compete and collaborate. You learn to play by yourself and with others. Most of all you learn to have a good time with friends and family- learning, laughing, and growing!
										
										Sore loser or Gracious Winner? 
										
										You are what you play!
