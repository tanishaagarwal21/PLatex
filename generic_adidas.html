										<h1>ADI DASSLER  </h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/addidassler.webp" alt="" /></span>
									<p> Adidas is one of the world’s most successful sports companies, with an annual revenue of more than € 23bn and a workforce of 60,000 around the world, but it started as a family business driven by the innovation and passion of a German man named Adolf Dassler.

										Adolf Dassler lived his whole life in a small rural town in Bavaria and created his first set of sports shoes by hand. His business almost collapsed on several occasions before it eventually became a global success. His remarkable life is a story of creativity, ingenuity, and, above all, a passion for sport.
										
										
									</p> 
									<h2>The Dassler Brothers’ Shoe Factory is born</h2>
									<p>Before he could begin turning his sports shoe idea into a business, Adolf Dassler was conscripted to the German Army in the late stages of World War I. When he returned to Herzogenaurach in 1919, Germany was stricken by post-war economic depression. Jobs were scarce, but determined not to let his dream die, and using characteristic creativity, Adolf converted the old laundry shed at the back of the Dassler family home into a shoe workshop. Using the shoemaking skills he had learned, he made money by repairing footwear for the local population.

										This finally gave him the time and resources to develop his first pairs of specialist sports shoes. One of his first innovations was a pair of spiked running shoes for track and field athletes, at the time this a brand-new concept for the sport. They featured hand-forged metal spikes supplied by the local blacksmith now run by Adolf’s childhood sports mate Fritz Zehlein.
									</p>
									<p>Adolf was as innovative in his manufacturing processes as he was in his shoe designs. To solve the problems caused by unreliable electricity supply he rigged a leather milling machine to a bicycle that was pedaled by the company’s first employee.

										Adolf was also joined in his endeavor by his older brother Rudolf Dassler and on July 1st, 1924 they registered their company ‘Gebrüder Dassler, Sportschuhfabrik, Herzogenaurach’ (‘Dassler Brothers Sports Shoe Factory’, Herzogenaurach). By 1925 their fledgling startup had three employees based in their one-room workshop, producing leather football boots with nailed studs, as well as spiked track shoes. As the German economic situation improved, business picked up and the brothers relocated to a bigger building in Herzogenaurach where they invested in new machinery and expanded their production.
