										<h1>BYJU RAVEENDRAN </h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/byjus1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Byju Raveendran was born in 1980 to a Malayaly family at Azhikode, a coastal village in Kerala and grew up in a joint family where my father’s sister and brother and their children also lived.

                                        His parents were both teachers. His father’s name is Raveendran. His mother’s name is Shobhanavalli.  His father is a Communist and retired physics teacher and his mother is a retired mathematics teacher.

									</p> 
									<h2>A teacher by choice and an entrepreneur by chance</h2>
									<p>Byju also attempted the exam along with his friends just for fun.  He was amazed when he got a score of 100 percentile in the final exam. 

                                        After seeing his amazing results, his friends advised starting a coaching class, teach students and aspiring themes for competitive exams. 
                                        
                                        He agreed, decided to resign from a highly paid job and started his coaching class. Byju began teaching students on the terrace of his close friend’s house and it is from here that the journey of Byju became a successful entrepreneur.
                                        
                                        Initially, Byju would only teach MBA aspirants, Byju started running full-time coaching classes.  He used to teach students for free of cost for a week.  He did face a fair share of challenges as an entrepreneur.
