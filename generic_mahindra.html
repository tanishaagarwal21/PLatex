										<h1>ANAND MAHINDRA </h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Anand-Mahindra2.webp" alt="" /></span>
									<p> Anand Mahindra was the third generation of the industrialist family. He was born to Harish and Indira Mahindra. His grandfather was Jagdish Mahindra, the co-founder of the empire of Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M).
										He completed his schooling at Lawrence School in Lovedale. Afterwards, he went to study film making and architecture. But it looks like that the fields were not his cup of tea. So, he completed his MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1981.

You would be surprised to know that Anand Mahindra and Bill Gates were classmates! What's more, he had a grudge against Gates! Because his daughter called him a loser because of Bill Gates.

He started his career as an Executive Assistant (Finance) in Mahindra Ugine Steel Company Ltd (MUSCO), soon after completing his MBA. After eight years, he got promoted to the position of President and Deputy Managing Director. He led to diversification in uncharted areas, like real estate development and hospitality management. 
									</p> 
									<h2>Anand Mahindra, Director of Mahindra & Mahindra, Business on Mind
									</h2>
									<p>
										Anand Mahindra is also the Co-Chairperson of the World Economic Forum. He was noted as ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ by Forbes (India) for 2013 and included by Fortune Magazine among the ‘World’s 50 Greatest Leaders.

Anand Mahindra also received the Rajiv Gandhi Award for his outstanding contributions to the business field.

He received the Leadership Award from the American India Foundation and awarded the person of the year award from Auto Monitor.

Mahindra & Mahindra Group operates in aftermarket, aerospace, components, agribusiness, defence, energy, automotive, construction equipment, insurance, farm equipment, finance, industrial equipment, hospitality, information technology, leisure, logistics, real estate, and retail.
