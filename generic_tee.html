										<h1>Creating Opportunities for Women to Grow:Lady Tee’s Journey to Advocacy</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/tee.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    
									<p>Lady Tee Thompson knows that when it comes to securing equal rights and opportunities for everyone — regardless of their gender, race, physical abilities, or socioeconomic status — progress does not come easy.

                                        She’s worked with public institutions in her home state of Michigan to protect access to education for women and marginalized students. And she’s taken on some of the most entrenched societal failures, from food insecurity to lack of economic opportunity, that are holding girls and women back around the world.
                                        
                                        She shares how her experiences as a disabled, marginalized, and minority woman entrepreneur have shaped and inspired her lifelong efforts to ensure women of all backgrounds have access to education and opportunity.
									</p> 
									<h2>What first motivated you to become an advocate for girls and women?</h2>
									<p>
                                        My first experience with advocacy was in 1989, when I was the student government president at Highland Park Community College. At the time it was the only HBCU (historically Black colleges and universities) in Michigan, and women made up a majority of the student body. Highland Park was a vital institution of higher education, offering underserved communities in the Detroit area opportunities to further their education and build careers, especially in the medical field; it was home to a top-graduating nursing program.
</p>
                                       <p>Unfortunately, the school was experiencing financial and administrative challenges, and by the time I was serving on student government, Highland Park was on the brink of closure. So I worked directly with the Michigan Board of Education to keep the school open for as long as possible.
                                        
                                        It was intimidating to speak before a big institution like the Board of Education as a young student, but I was determined to keep the school open. If Highland Park had shut its doors then, the most marginalized students — those who were low income or homeless, physically disabled, or lacked access to technology at home — would have been the most severely affected.
                                        
                                        In the end, I managed to help keep Michigan’s top-graduating two-year HBCU open for several more years. Sadly, the school ultimately closed, but I am proud that I was able to help more women and marginalized students change their socioeconomic trajectories in those final years.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Being the voice of my community — representing Highland Park Community College — before a massive institution was a turning point for me. I realized that I could have a seat at the proverbial table. From that point on, I realized that I could help make a difference for those who were most at risk of being left behind. My passion for advancing equality — especially gender equality — grew from there.
                                        
                                        And just as important, it helped me to see that making a real difference means overcoming more than one obstacle. It takes persistence to knock down barrier after barrier to progress.
