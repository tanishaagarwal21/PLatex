										<h1>MELANIN PERKINS </h1>
									</header>

									<p>Whether you’re a blogger, marketer, or business owner, you have surely used Canva as a go-to tool for creating stunning graphics for your business or personal projects. But did you know that behind this powerful design tool stands a fabulous young woman whose creativity and vision have transformed how people approach visual communication?

                                        At just 30 years old, Melanie Perkins became one of the youngest female tech unicorn founders when her company, Canva, was valued at $1 billion only five years after its launch in 2013. As Canva continues to expand and pursue ambitious goals, the company’s valuation rapidly increases, making her the most successful founder in Sydney since Atlassian.
                                        
                                        Today, Canva is valued at a staggering $25 billion, making it one of the most successful startups in history and one of the earliest to quickly reach this level of success. She has also committed to donating her 30% ownership in Canva to charitable causes and intends to make a difference in the world by combating poverty. But behind these impressive numbers lies an incredible story of perseverance, creativity, and a passion for breaking down barriers in design. 
                                        
                                        In May 2021, Melanie Perkins was considered one of the wealthiest women in Australia, with a net worth of $6.5 billion. Then, she was honored by being inducted into the 30 Under 30 Hall of Fame in 2022 and, later on, was featured on Forbes’ Billionaires list for 2023. And this all despite not having a college degree.
									</p> 
									<h2>Story behind: Why did Melanie create Canva?</h2>
									<p>Melanie Perkins’ journey to becoming the youngest self-made tech billionaire is awe-inspiring. Melanie was born in Perth, Australia, in 1987. She was always passionate about figure skating and would normally wake up at 4:30 a.m. every day for training. Engaging in sports instilled in her a mindset of setting and striving for objectives and cultivating an ambitious attitude.

                                        At the age of 14, Perkins started her first business selling handmade scarves at markets and shops throughout Perth, which she considers to have developed her entrepreneurial drive. 
                                        
                                        After high school, Perkins enrolled in the University of Western Australia and studied Communications Psychology and Commerce. Simultaneously, she was working as a private tutor for graphic design students, where she, for the first time, noticed the difficulties students had in learning complex design programs such as Adobe Photoshop.
                                        
                                        ¨People would have to spend an entire semester learning where the buttons were, and that seemed completely ridiculous. I thought that in the future, it was all going to be online and collaborative and much, much simpler than these really hard tools.¨ shares Melanie in the interview with CNBC International on how the whole idea came up.
                                        
                                        Her concept involved developing a design platform that did not require any technical expertise from people. But back then, Melanie and her future husband, slash business partner, Cliff Obrecht, didn’t have enough resources and technical expertise to develop a complex design software, so they decided to start with a specific product category – high school yearbooks – and founded their first company, Fusion Books in 2007. </p>
