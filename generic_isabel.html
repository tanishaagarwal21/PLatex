										<h1>The Story of  Isabel Liu </h1>

                                    <p>Isabel Liu wants to leverage technology for social good. As a Teen Advisor for Girl Up and a Community Ambassador for the free coding camp Kode with Klossy, the 17-year-old Taiwanese American teenager has witnessed the gender disparity in STEM firsthand. Now she’s raising her voice in rooms traditionally dominated by boys and men to help reclaim and reshape what’s possible for the next generation of computer scientists and storytellers, regardless of their gender
                                        </p>
                                    <h2>Why do you think storytelling is such a powerful tool when it comes to advocating for the rights of girls and women?</h2>

									
									<p> Storytelling is how we have always passed down human history, and it is how I like to pass on my values and experiences, too. I feel incredibly blessed to be a part of female- and genderqueer-centered organizations like Girl Up and Kode with Klossy, which have lent me their platforms to speak out on issues I care about, such as the gender disparity in STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]. Carrying my stories with me, I have interviewed female CEOs, performed spoken-word poetry incentivizing feminist philanthropy, emceed festivals celebrating gender justice advocates, and connected with girls around the world to better understand our collective needs and dreams. Because storytelling is such a fundamental aspect of human existence, it is something that I think resonates with all of us.

                                        Everyone’s story is unique, and that is what they bring to the table. I remember in the beginning of last year, when I was invited to be on a panel alongside Taiwanese scientific and government officials, I was so frightened because I thought I did not have anything worthwhile to say. How could I possibly compare myself with people who had lived and worked my lifetime three times over?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Gender equality advocate Isabel Liu speaks on a panel at the Global Initiatives Symposium.
                                        But when I got up onto that stage, I realized since all of the other panelists were men, and were all much older than me, they could not think like me, a 17-year-old girl. I was able to introduce ideas regarding youths and girls that other panelists could not think of, or were unaware of, because they had not experienced it themselves — ideas that put female and genderqueer youth at the forefront of social change.

That is why I spend a lot of my time writing and speaking, to make other girls realize that their stories are also worth sharing. Your existence — and your story — is your power. No one can take that away from you.
                                    </p>
