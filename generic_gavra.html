										<h1>The Story of Gavra</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/gavra.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    <h2>Our work with Gavra</h2>
									<p> I remember the day I arrived at Gavra’s one room stone-slab hut in Dayakaur, a village in Rajasthan, India. A new house was under construction next to her residence. Gavra’s husband, Ram Lal yelled down to me as he was laying down stone slabs, telling me they were grateful for the taanka. I too felt grateful especially for the opportunity to interview his wife.
									</p> 
									<h2>In Gavra's words</h2>
									<p> Before receiving her taanka, Gavra would wake at 3 am to make the six mile walk to collect water at the village naadi, a rainwater catchment pond. She made the walk five times a day in the debilitating heat. Each load she carried consisted of two pots, each weighing 45 lb., balanced on her head.

                                        When Gavra invited me into her home, she took off her purdah, (a scarf used to veil her face). I admired her strong, serene beauty. She offered to make us tea, but I politely refused, not wanting to add more work to her household duties. I felt a sense of anxiety from Gavra because our meeting was taking her away from her work, but as our conversation unfolded, I could sense her relax for the first time as she realized she had an opportunity to tell her story to another woman in her own voice. With the help of a translator, Gavra shared her hardships, her tears, her emotions, and, finally, her joys with me (especially now that she has a taanka).</p>
									<p>
                                        As soon as I moved in with my husband there were a lot of problems with scarce water. My mother-in-law did not did not allow me to have water to drink or bathe. I asked her where to get water and she told me about the naadi (rainwater catchment pond). So I started walking there several times a day with pots to carry water home and by the time I would get back I was so tired, but I could not rest. I had to do other chores like cooking, grinding wheat for flour, and milking the cows. I was not facing this problem when I was living at my parent’s house as a girl.”
									</p>
                                    <p>Our whole family faced very bad conditions before the taanka. I would take my children with me so they could help me carry water. We needed water for everything, like washing clothes, cooking, but sometimes we didn’t have enough water for 4 to 5 days. To brush our teeth, we had to share 1 cup of water. Whatever water I carried in pots was used for drinking only – there was no water for bathing, so how could the kids go to school without bathing?”</p>
