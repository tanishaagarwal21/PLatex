									<p>Why did Apple’s board fire Steve Jobs in 1985?
										There is perhaps no more extraordinary corporate success comeback story than that of Steve Jobs and Apple. 

In 1985, Jobs was the co-founder and visionary of Apple yet was unceremoniously fired by Apple’s board.

Eleven years later, he would be asked to return and rebuild Apple into one of the most unique and successful businesses and brands of all time.

Jobs’ story would become an American classic and one that would have ample lessons for anyone interested in boardroom dynamics. 

First, however, it begs the question: What happened? Why did Steve Jobs get fired?

									</p> 
									<h2>Steve Jobs hired the man who would later fire him</h2>
									<p>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak famously started Apple in a garage and began to develop their unique business strategy. 
									
										The two men had a rough breakdown of business responsibilities: Jobs handled business and creativity, while Wozniak engineered their creations. 
										
										Of course, the responsibilities weren’t entirely as set as this, but this rough breakdown allowed Apple to get off the ground and begin creating. 
										
										The problem? Both Jobs and Wozniak were young men without any real business experience, and they needed expert guidance if they were going to get their company off the ground. So they built a board and brought business experts to help get the fledging tech company going. 
										
										And that they did. Apple began to churn out revolutionary computer products, led by the genius of Jobs and Wozniak. Jobs, however, wanted to be CEO. The board pushed back.
										
										Part of the push-back was Jobs’ way with people, which was allegedly terrible and autocratic. 
										
										Jobs famously pushed people too hard, rubbed people the wrong way, and burned bridges left and right. He was building an incredible business but making everyone around him unhappy. 
										
										As a result, Apple’s board believed he wasn’t ready for the CEO role.
										
										In 1983, Jobs recruited the CEO of PepsiCo, John Sculley, to work for Apple. 
										
										Unfortunately, this hiring would only accelerate Jobs’ demise. </p>
