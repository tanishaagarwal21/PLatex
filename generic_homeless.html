                                    <p>Fortunately, the startup community is on the job.  With all the power of entrepreneurship at their backs, companies around the country are doing their part in building up homeless people in a way that will set them up for success in the future. These are not charitable organizations; these are companies that are supporting the skill sets of the homeless to give them a fresh startup in society.

                                        Take a look at a few companies below that are doing their part to make life a little better for homeless people in this country.</p>
                                
                                
                                <h2>Miracle Messages</h2>
                                <p>Miracle Messages reconnects people living on the streets with their loved ones, through short video messages and social media. To date, 40 percent of reunions have lead to stable housing. Founder Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Messages in honor of his Uncle Mark, who lived on-and-off the streets for 30 years. Their goal is to reunite 1 million people by 2021.
                                    The most effective way to help is to
                                    Transform a life by committing 1 hour a week as a phone buddy for an unhoused friend, or serving as a digital detective. 
                                    
                                    We’ll provide you with training, mentoring, and support as part of our community.
                                    
                                    We envision a world where people embrace their unhoused neighbors as people to be loved, not problems to be solved. </p>

                                    <h2>HandUp</h2>
                                <p>HandUp partners with non-profit human services organizations to raise money online for homeless people.

                                <h2>ArtLifting</h2>
                                <p>ArtLifting empowers homeless, disabled, and other disadvantaged individuals through the celebration and sale of their artwork. Artists' work is sold through an online art gallery and direct to businesses, including offices, hotels, and restaurants.ArtLifting is about creating opportunity, empowerment, and validation. We offer artists the chance to secure their own income through the sale of original paintings, prints, and products. By showcasing and selling artwork via ArtLifting, artists gain self-confidence that permeates all aspects of their lives. As a social enterprise and benefit corporation, we are using “business for good.” Every artist earns 55% of the profit from the sale of their work; 1% from each sale goes to a fund, which provides art supplies to art groups nationwide; and ArtLifting uses the remaining 44% to further our mission. We realize that in order to make sustainable change, we need to run a financially sustainable business.

                                    Liz explains: “When I realized that there was no company similar, I knew that ArtLifting had to be founded. The infrastructure (art programs in shelters and disability centers) was already in place, and the artists were already creating art.  The only thing missing was a marketplace for this art. ArtLifting gives these artists a platform to sell their artwork.”<b> “My goal is to make their invisible talents visible and by doing so, change stereotypes. Instead of defining people by their circumstance, we should define them by their talent.”
