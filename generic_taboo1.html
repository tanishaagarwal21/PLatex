										<h1> What Even Is Taboo? </h1>

                                    <p><b>A social or religious custom prohibiting or forbidding discussion of a particular practice or forbidding association with a particular person, place, or thing.</b>
                                        Thanks, Google. When I hear or see the word ‘taboo’, I typically think of pretty hardcore subjects. I’ve mentioned some already but what immediately springs to mind for me are subjects around sexual deviance, I wonder what that says about me.

                                        But using the definition above, taboo can mean all sorts of things, in reality. In the UK for example, it would be considered taboo to cut into a queue, or perhaps putting milk in before the hot water when making tea (that’s right, I said it).
                                        
                                        For most people in the West, this also includes talking about politics, religion, and salary in the workplace. But those kinds of things don’t usually make for exciting stories in themselves — they make for precise details though.
                                        
                                        As I have so far hinted, I am talking about how to write the darker stuff.
                                    </p>
                                    
									<h2>Face Your Own Fears</h2>
                                    <p>Take some time to really examine your fears. What haunted you as a child? Better still, what disturbs you even now as an adult? Where did those fears come from?

                                        I’m not just talking about things like “I’m scared of spiders because they’re ugly and creepy!” etc. I’m talking about deep-down fears; the stuff that unsettles you and frightens you on an instinctual level.
                                        
                                        For me, just as an example, I become unsettled by the idea of the death of my siblings (we’re very close) as well as my own occasional lack of empathy. Though for my thesis, I focussed on my fear of never really knowing who I am.
                                        
                                        Once you’ve looked a little deeper into your fears, try writing about them — fiction or otherwise.
                                        
                                        While characters need to have some kind of fear (otherwise readers struggle to identify or empathise with them), I’ve come across some great stories that deal with anxiety as the central theme too.
                                        
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Write Ambiguously — or Don’t</h2>
                    <p>These days, I think we can get away with a lot in storytelling, not much truly shocks us or our audience anymore. However, there are still subjects that dance across the line of acceptability — mainly if you’re aiming for publication or the screen.

                        Things like paedophilia (hello ‘Lolita’) or incest (hello ‘Game of Thrones’) are typically written with ambiguity or symbolism. But even something more lighthearted like poo (or handling it) gets people talking because no one talks about shitting much, so it becomes memorable when you do.
                        
                        Perhaps one of the better examples of elliptical language to hide taboo is ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’ by Oscar Wilde. At the time, homosexuality was illegal in England, where he resided. But despite not actually spelling out the nature of the relationships, he was eventually imprisoned for “gross indecency” after the release of the book.
                        
                        Notwithstanding, these days it’s not to say you can’t write about these subjects with directness, openly exploring them — just know that your audience will be limited.
                        
                        There are exceptions, of course, there always are. Game of Thrones is an excellent example of a well-loved series (excluding its debatable TV ending) which unapologetically has the main plotline dealing with sibling incest. That is on top of other taboo subjects like homosexuality (sadly still considered taboo in many places), rape and paedophilia (Daenerys is about 12/13 when she’s married off by her brother in the books).
