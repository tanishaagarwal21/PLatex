                                        It was back in 2009, Dhivik Ashok, the then 25-year-old entrepreneur, and his father Ashok sat in their living room to discuss the future of mobility in India. From there, together, they went on to form the electric scooter company GoGreenBOV. By 2015, the father-son duo had a million dollars in revenue, and were poised to grow bigger. But, in 2016, the two realised their bikes were dying early because of lead acid batteries. And so, the team went deep into R&D from the profits they had made. Soon, the market wrote them off. Today, Dhivik is a 35-year-old man, wiser beyond his years. He knows the electric vehicle industry inside out. After spending three years in the jungle, the GGBOV team is back with a bang. And unknown to many, the company is piloting its bikes with a major ride-hailing company. It also has a bunch of delivery and ecommerce companies talking to it to acquire its solution. And the company also has a blueprint for a B2C business for 2020. Their investment of Rs 6 crore seems to have paid off, or has it? The new bike shown in the picture below shows Dhivik testing the bike by himself in Bengaluru. Dhivik says he has tested this bike over more than 100,000 km.

                                        <h2>The early days</h2>

                                        GGBOV had a very unassuming beginning. Up until 2009, the father-son duo had been retro-fitting gas kits to cars for almost a decade, and realised the bet on electric vehicles because the total cost of ownership was cheaper than petrol-run two-wheelers. Early vehicles could go up to 80 km for just eight rupees. They invested Rs 24 lakh and began sourcing electric vehicle components from China, assembled them in Bengaluru, and sold them to over 50 customers. The first batch was an absolute hit in terms of sales. But there were several unhappy customers too. The bikes had motor issues, refused to start sometimes, and would stall. That’s when the company began to take control of components like battery and motor that they should order and perfected the assembly. And so, GGBOV became an R&D company. Around the same time, in 2010, Chetan Maini’s electric car company Reva was acquired by Mahindra & Mahindra and GGBOV realised that interest in electric vehicles was picking up in India. The government continued to provide a subsidy to electric bikes up to Rs 20,000. The fascination for low-cost bikes continued with a few customers in India and GGBOV sold around 2,500 vehicles. In 2014 and 2015, the interest levels peaked as the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan proposed subsidies drove more individuals to buy electric bikes. GGBOV sold around 10,000 pieces by 2015, and a large ecommerce company decided to work with them as well. At the time, the company had 86 employees and were looking at big deals. Like a majority of electric bike companies, GGBOV were also operating in the lead acid category as lithium battery/cells cost was prohibitive. While the former was at $190 per kwh, the latter cost around 700$ per kwh. Says Dhivik,
