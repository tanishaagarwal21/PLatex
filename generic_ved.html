									<h2> Ved Krishna – Regenerating the Environment with Chuk – Biodegradable, Disposable Tableware</h2>
									<p>
										Disposable plates that are 100 per cent compostable or biodegradable, decomposing within two to six months depending on the conditions – two in a composter and six if left to the elements.
										Bowls and containers that hold not only dry food but are also strong enough to hold wet sauces and curries that are so typical of Indian foods. And, yet are lightweight. What’s more? They can easily be used for heating unlike plastics which leach out bisphenol A (BPA), a carcinogenic agent, upon heating, making them unsuitable for warming food or holding hot foods.
										These are products made from wonder material Bagasse or sugarcane residue, which is left over after sugarcane stalks are crushed to extract the juice. Thus, they are biodegradable and environment friendly. Bagasse is converted into pulp, mixed with water and moulded in machines into a multiple range of tableware products with the help of steam. These are Chuk products, certified by FDA! Chuk, a premier company manufacturing biodegradable tableware, was established by Ved Krishna in 2014.</p> 
									<h3>Chuck Easy with Chuk</h3>
									<p>Since his strength was access to bagasse, which could be moulded into any shape, the businessman in Ved determined to use it for a biodegradable product. Having been associated with the food industry by virtue of packaging he soon focused on replacing styrofoam, which can be used only once, for an average of 15 minutes, and then rests in landfills forever. After an intensive four-year struggle of research and development, Chuk was born in 2014.</p>
									<p>However, just the development of bagasse into a mouldable and yet strong, food-grade product was not enough for Ved. He got his team to embark on a year-long research on how India eats. And, to their surprise they found that how India eats is very different from how the disposable plates available in the market were designed, which were more suited to the Western palate of dry foods. So, Chuk plates were made with more compartments to suit the variety in the Indian cuisine. Even the containers were deeper to hold the liquids/ gravies better.
										The rules of business were once again rewritten as what worked before was no longer an option. The plant was commissioned in 2016 with Rs. 60 crore investment and launched in 2017.

True genius, they say, lies in simplicity. And simplicity led to the modular design of the product in a partnership with Therefore Design. The genius is in the way that the product can be used –   either singly or stacked in a variety of space-saving stacking combinations using the 180 ml bowl as the smallest unit. This versatile design earned Chuk numerous awards like the CII Design Excellence Award 2017 and the prestigious Red Dot Award 2018 for best high design quality in the world. Chuk also won the Good Design Award 2018 that confers the G-Mark recognising new innovations that are guided by humanity (creativity), honesty (ability to see the nature of modern society), innovation, esthetics, and ethics (thoughtfulness to shape society and the environment). And, Chuk fulfils the criteria so beautifully.
