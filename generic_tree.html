                                    <h2>How do we introduce Clan Earth to you?</h2>
									<p>Two individuals, sharing a dream that seemed impossible at best, began a journey of selfless helping that birthed itself into a entrepreneurial venture that is steadily growing and wondrously giving back to the world the goodness and nurturing it needs.
                                        Meet Priyanka Mandal and Broteen Biswas of Clan Earth – a duo that has blended business and sustainability seamlessly in their venture.Clan Earth is an ‘Earth-First company’ who manufactures backpacks, bags and wallets from sustainable eco friendly material from start to finish, combining it with their self appointed mission to plant 1 million trees by 2030 and become India’s most impactful Social Enterprise while doing that. So every time a sale of one of their products happen, 5 trees are planted. Incredible isn’t it!

									</p> 
									<h2>This ‘bootstrap’ company has etched itself a long and illustrious journey ahead </h2>
									<p>But the story has a beginning and though long winded, it led in a sure and steady way to the venture Clan Earth is at the moment.
                                        The Road not taken-
                                        It is a persistent interest in empowering the underprivileged that is the one common thread running through the lives of the two young entrepreneurs – Priyanka was volunteering with the Make a Difference foundation, while she pursued engineering at IEM. Broteen joined forces with Priyanka when she independently decided to teach the impoverished families living in the proximity of the Bally bridge. The meaningful engagement they had with the 20 odd families and their children who lived under the Bally bridge on the suburbs of Calcutta, laid the foundation of the desire to do more than just teach English and some crafting skills.
                                        Unlike most other young people who end their philanthropy with the acquisition of a degree, Priyanka and her likeminded friend decided to continue their efforts, devoting their free time after their working hour, along with Saturdays to the cause of making these families hope for a better life for themselves.
                                        Gradually, working with the realities on ground zero, made them realize that Crafting was the most popular and viable option among the people there, specially also because many of the girls were married off at extremely young ages and sought to do something more to support themselves in their new and often difficult situations.
                                        The idea was now beginning to take shape and form, with forays into thinking about how to run small businesses, how to build teams, how to figure out accounting, product photography , legalities– basically everything that a start-up would need to worry about from scratch. The experience gained from making and selling of the crafts at NGO fairs, CSR events, gave them some back up in this unchartered territory, and so did challenges like scaling of the handicrafts.
                                        This led to the genesis of Clan Earth in January 2020 as a fully profit oriented business venture, after an entire year spent in planning and exploration. What added value and a distinct touch of uniqueness to this venture was its amalgamation of business and sustainability. Genuine concerns about carbon footprints businesses tend to create, and the lack of any investment into the very planet that sustains Mankind was the obvious motivation for creating such a challenging business model. </p>
									<p> Bags was the popular choice of their launch of their product line because it is not gender specific, and because of its options in manufacturing.
                                        Till now, largely bags in the market were made of either leather or polyester- both disqualified because of the cruelty associated with the former and the irreversible harm that is a natural collateral of the latter. Therefore the challenge was to find alternatives that would be natural and all sustainable.
                                        So the first bag, the now famous and most sold Pangolin bag, was launched in mid-January 2020 and by judging at the reviews coming in, Clan Earth made a mark it was hoping for, across the board.
                                        A very important addition to every purchase made from Clan Earth, is the customer’s involvement in actually being associated, through Clan Earth, with the planting of no less than 5 trees! In a tie up with an international organization, Clan Earth contributes its revenue made from sales every quarter, to reforestation all over the world within that month. This international organization has been around for over a decade and a half, and works with the locals to plant exactly the kind of trees needed to replenish the soil of that area.
                                        Clan Earth, built on hopes and dreams and being nurtured on ethics and hardwork was definitely impacted by the pandemic. But work has not stopped and neither has the dreaming, planning and executing.
                                        The ring of excitement and zeal in Priyanka’s voice as she talks about Clan Earth, reflects in the finesse and sturdiness of their products and the honesty in their enterprise.</p>
